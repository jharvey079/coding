# INSTRUCTIONS: 
# Choose the correct data-casting function to fix the following code snippets.
# Reference the python datacasting functions on W3schools.com for guidance. 

# str() - Changes any data type into a string.
# int() - Changes any data type into a integer (whole number)
# float() - Changes any data type into a float (decimal number)
# ??? 

# Problem 1
Name = input('What is your name: ') 
Age = input('What is your age: ')

print('Hello my name is ' + Name  + ' I am ' + Age +  ' years old.')
# String concatenation - combining 2 or strings

# Problem 2
Bonus = '200'
print(300 +  int(Bonus)) # result should be 500

# Problem 3
# HINT: use w3schools to find a data casting function that will change
# a data type into a boolean

Value = 'true'

print(True == Value) # result should be true
