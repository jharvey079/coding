# quiz rules:
# - There is no talking during the quiz
# - You may only use your classnotes and w3schools.com for reference
# - If you have a question about a quiz question, please raise your hand
# - Once finished, submit your code to your repository using the source control 
# button. Your commit should be "completed quiz 1."

# 1. Name and describe three (3) built-in functions in python. 
"print, input function, string"
# Please write your responses in complete sentences.

# 2. What data type will the following snippet of code output?
print(30/ 232)
"0.12931034482758622"

# 3.  Identify and name the operator family each of the following
# symbols belongs to.

# and
"	Returns True if both statements are true	x < 5 and  x < 10"
# ==
"	Equal	x == y"
# >
"Greater than	x > y"

# 4. Explain the difference between the = operator and the == operator.
# Please write your response in complete sentences.
"the = operator 	x = 5	x = 5 while the == operator is 	Equal	x == y"

# 5. Write code that takes a userâ€™s input (as a string), 
# casts it to a float, and prints the result multiplied by 2.
"x = float(2)"

# 6. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?
# Please write your response in complete sentences.
"A parameter is a value,	a number or a string that can be converted into a floating point number and an argument is what removes that converting floating point number"

# 7. What is the difference between a function definition 
# and a function invocation? # Please write your response in 
# complete sentences.
"In Python a function is defined using the def keyword: and a function invocation is what calls the function"

# 8. Why are functions useful in programming? Provide at least two reasons 
# and write your reasons in in complete sentences.
"Function are useful in programming because they organize things and they can make things work, they can calculate stuff and have inputs and outputs."

# 9. Write a code block that uses the appropriate operator for each scenario
x = 15
y = 20.
# x is greater than y
# x and 15 are both the same
# x and y are not the same`
"print(x=20, y=15"

# 10. Create a function that will take in two values. Your function should
# take in 1 value as a parameter, and the other value should be passed in by the
# user through the terminal. Your function should compare if the number passed in by
# the user is greater than the number passed in via the parameter and should print out
# the appropriate response of true or false.
"def my_function(): print("true or false")"
